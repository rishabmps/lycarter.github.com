After graduation, I wanted to go travel a bit, and especially visit some friends on the west coast that I haven't seen for a while, and probably won't get to see for a little while. Hunter has been working in Seattle and is moving back to Boston soon, so it was also a good opportunity to visit her before she moved.

I arrived Thursday night, with an excellent view on the approach in to SeaTac.

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-1_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "views from plane")_The approach into SeaTac was one of the best I've seen, excellent views of Mt. Rainier and the surrounding landscape._

Since I'd just flown from the east coast, I was about 3 hours ahead, and woke up early Friday morning. Hunter went off to work and I headed towards Seattle Center, to see the Space Needle and some nearby attractions, which most notably included the Museum of Popular Culture, a beautiful Frank Gehry building that photographed well from every single angle.

<p class="tiny">Here's where I wish I had some sort of gallery feature, instead just have a wall of photos...</p>

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-4_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "classic Space Needle photo")_The classic view of the Space Needle with a beautiful blue sky background. The whole Seattle Center area felt like Tomorrowland, from Disney World, but less fake. It was extremely geometric and saturated._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-6_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "views from Space Needle")_An excellent view of the Puget Sound from the top of the Space Needle._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-5_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "recent upgrades improved the view")_Although parts of the Space Needle were still being renovated (and thus had almost no views of Downtown Seattle), the renovations were to replace the glass and drastically improve the view._

Heading to this area was definitely best done in the early morning. I arrived around 9, and there weren't many people around. By the time I'd gone down from the Space Needle and had wandered around for a bit, it was around 11, and starting to get pretty crowded.

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-7_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "mopop was beautiful from every angle")_MoPOP, angle 1._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-8_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "mopop was beautiful from every angle")_MoPOP, angle 2._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-9_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "mopop was beautiful from every angle")_MoPOP, angle 3. Definitely resembled Tomorrowland with the monorail passing through it._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-14_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "mopop was beautiful from every angle")_MoPOP, angle 4._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-15_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "mopop was beautiful from every angle")_MoPOP, angle 5._


![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-16_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "mopop was beautiful from every angle")_MoPOP, angle 6._


![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-17_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "mopop was beautiful from every angle")_MoPOP, angle 7: This was almost exactly the angle of a Windows 7 desktop background._

After walking around Seattle Center/MoPOP, I wandered towards the Olympic Sculpture Park, which continued with the trend of saturated and geometric shapes.

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-10_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "seattle is hipster af")_Wandering toward the Olympic Sculpture Park, I came across a new mural being painted on the side of a coffee shop - about as hipster as can be._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-11_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "olympic sculpture park")_The Olympic Sculpture Park was very peaceful in the morning, just a few people relaxing, and people riding bikes passing by._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-12_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "olympic sculpture park")_In the Olympic Sculpture Park, there was an area where you could climb down to the water level. There were some awesome textures with algae and rocks._

After the Olympic Sculpture Park, I turned south and walked along the waterfront toward Pike Place, intending to meet up with Hunter for lunch. Pike's Place was super vibrant, lots of cute little stores and coffee shops and bars and restaurants. I could definitely have stayed there and explored more, and it seemed like the place to be on a Friday or Saturday night.


![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-13_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "pike place")_Wandering through Pike's Place seems to be the quintessential Seattle experience - hipster and vibrant (and surprisingly hilly)._

I met up with Hunter for lunch and we went to a food court/restaurant place nearby and got some excellent pasta. We also caught the tail end of the Spain/Portugal game, which had an exciting conclusion, back and forth, with Ronaldo kicking in an equalizer at 88', finishing the game in a 3-3 draw. In the afternoon, I went back to Seattle Center to actually go inside MoPOP. The Marvel exhibit was interesting, especially the original costumes and some of the original artwork for the comic books. The rest of the museum was a bit too music-centric for my taste.

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-2_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "air guitar: please do not touch")_MoPOP had a decent sense of humor, though the overall focus was definitely more music-skewed than my tastes._

I stopped by [DeLaurenti](http://www.delaurenti.com/) in Pike Place per Hunter's suggestion, a pretty nice organic/meat and cheese and wine type of store, and picked up some pasta and wine for dinner. I suggested making Pasta Aglio e Olio, the most popular [Binging with Babish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJUiWdM__Qw) episode, though I utterly failed at estimating the 1 tsp of red pepper flakes the recipe called for, and we instead wound up with a palate-cleansing level of spiciness. No photos of that, because I can do better another time and maybe make a proper post about it.

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-3_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "sunset from Hunter's building")_Hunter's building had an awesome view of the sunset from the roof, though I would have killed for a proper telephoto._

That pretty much concluded Friday, which was an awesome day, and instantly upgraded Seattle to probably my favorite west coast city.

Saturday, we met up with a couple of friends that were in Seattle for the summer and hiked Rattlesnake Ledge, a ~5 mile round trip hike with excellent views. There were 3 tiers of lookout points - Rattlesnake Ledge, Middle Ledge, and Upper Ledge, with Rattlesnake Ledge being the largest and most popular. We stopped by each, and they each offered unique and excellent views. The climb was a little steep, with about 2k ft of climbing in just 2 miles, but otherwise was pretty easy. It was definitely best to arrive in the morning, as we saw an absolute zoo of cars when we left around noon.

<p class="tiny">Again this is about where I wish I had some sort of gallery feature...</p>

Saturday night, we went to [Poppy](http://www.poppyseattle.com/) for dinner, which had really interesting thali combinations. I didn't take photos, because I'm not usually in to taking photos of dinners that I didn't cook - dinner at a restaurant should be enjoyed for the experience, I think.

Sunday, we visited the Arboretum, which was very pretty in the early summer - everything was green and there were lots of flowers.

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-28_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "stream in the Arboretum")_Stream in the Japanese Gardens in the Arboretum._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-30_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "koi")_Koi._

Sunday afternoon, we went to [Ada's Technical Bookstore](https://www.seattletechnicalbooks.com/), which had an amazing vibe, and super interesting selection of books. If I weren't just visiting, I probably would have walked out with at least 3 books. Added to my list were:

- [Cook's Science](https://www.amazon.com/Cooks-Science-Unlock-Favorite-Ingredients/dp/1940352452/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), a pretty cool looking cookbook with fairly technical descriptions.
- [The Oldest Living Things in the World](https://www.amazon.com/Oldest-Living-Things-World/dp/022605750X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), a gorgeous coffee-table book of nature images.
- [The 12 Bottle Bar](https://www.amazon.com/12-Bottle-Bar-Bottles-Cocktails/dp/076117494X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), a cocktail recipe book that used only 12 base ingredients (and had plenty of suggestions for if you just wanted to use 3-5 ingredients). I hardly drink, but cocktails offer a large variety of flavors and combinations that appeal to me.
- [Artemis](https://www.amazon.com/Artemis-Novel-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B06Y55SB48/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529360808&sr=8-1), a novel by author of *The Martian* that I didn't know existed.
- [Blackfish City](https://www.amazon.com/Blackfish-City-Sam-J-Miller-ebook/dp/B071DSNY9G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529360817&sr=8-1), a dystopian city novel, which mostly caught my eye due to the interesting cover art (yes, yes, judge a cover by the book, etc).

Sunday evening, Hunter had a lamb burger recipe for us to try, with arugula, roasted bell peppers, and a mint/lime yogurt. It was excellent, the burgers were some of the best I've ever had.

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-32_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "lamb burgers, assembled")_Lamb burgers, fully assembled and delicious._

Monday, Hunter was at work again, so I explored the [Starbuck's Roastery](https://www.starbucksreserve.com/) in the morning, and the [Amazon Biospheres](https://www.seattlespheres.com/) exhibit in the afternoon. I'm not a huge coffee fan, but I was promised that the roastery was interesting for its aesthetics and engineering, which definitely undersold it. It was super interesting to see all of the machines and hoppers and sensors, and they had a gigantic split-flap display, which is probably my favorite type of updateable signage.

![]({{ "/assets/img/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-41.gif" | absolute_url }} "split-flap display at Starbucks roastery")_Massive split-flap display at the Starbucks Roastery showed information on the specialized roastings available._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-34_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "architecture drawing")_There was a "library" section with architectural drawings and renderings of the space, very similar to what we might have draw in 2.744._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-35_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "matching hoppers")_The matching hoppers in real life, with whimsical yet functional tubes for bean delivery._

![]({{ "/assets/img/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-42.gif" | absolute_url }} "bean chain conveyor")_To transport the beans between hoppers, roasters, grinders, and other pieces of machinery, tubes with plungers connected by chain were used - the space between each set of plungers holds one bag worth of beans, and allows the beans to be transported in tubes in any orientation. Truly, Seattle's infinite coffee is an amazing sight._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-37_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "fancy oven")_The bakery inside had some of the most [entertainingly over-the-top ovens](https://www.miwe.eu/download/produktinformation_wenz1919_en.pdf) I've seen: pure rustic, wood-fired look on the front, but actually ultra-sophisticated electronic controls, accessed from the side._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-38_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "high tech controls")_Super modern controls with very obviously custom software ran most of the roastery, but appropriately-dressed men with beards in jeans were present to add to the effect._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-39_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "macarons")_I stopped by another coffee shop on the way back, which had some amazing-looking macarons._

![]({{ "/assets/img/thumbnail/2018-06-18-seattle-trip-40_thumb_800.jpg" | absolute_url }} "tea")_I'm not much of a coffee guy, so I got tea at a coffee shop nearby after visiting the roastery._


Amazon Biospheres sadly wasn't really available for public tours except by appointment on Saturdays, which I didn't realize until planning my day Monday morning. They did have a small visitor's center with some interactive videos about the space, the theory behind it, the construction, and other details. That was all pretty interesting - it looks like a really nice space to walk around (though I don't think I could be productive there). It also didn't look like it was being very heavily utilized (though, to be fair, it was near the end of the work day when I visited).

After Amazon Biospheres, I wandered around a bit more, then went up to University Village to grab dinner with another friend - we went to [Sizzle and Crunch](http://sizzleandcrunch.com/), a perfectly passable Vietnamese Chipotle-style restaurant. There were also some awesome bike trails around that area, which I would have loved to ride if I'd had a bike with me.

## Overall Thoughts

This was my first time visiting Seattle, or the Pacific Northwest at all. Everything felt very green, both in the metaphorical sense of environmentalism and the literal sense of foliage. Seattle itself was hillier than I'd expected, but it was incredibly easy to get around via buses or light rail - the bus network was probably the most useful of any city I've been in. There was also a shocking abundance of rack-less bicycle shares, the bikes littered every corner. There were coffee shops everywhere, all sharing the bring-a-macbook-and-read-the-new-yorker vibe. The city was clean and the air was clear, though I also lucked out with a beautiful weekend of weather - sunny and low 70's the whole time. Seattle has probably jumped to my #1 favorite west-coast city.
