TA'ing 2.009 and 2.744 has roughly been my full-time job for the past year or so, and 2.744 just wrapped up. This has been an incredibly rewarding, frustrating thing to do, and I've learned a lot. I'll try to expand on that, but it's hard to enumerate all the things that I've learned, because so much of it is soft skills.

# Background
First, some background. I was a double-major as an undergrad, 2A and 6-3, so I took 2.009 in Fall 2016, graduated Spring 2017, TA'd 2.009 Fall 2017, TA'd 2.744 Spring 2018 (I haven't ever taken 2.744). Both classes are taught by [Professor David Wallace](http://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/DRWALLAC@MIT.EDU)

## 2.009
[2.009](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/index.html) is MIT's MechE capstone class, "Product Engineering Processes". Students are assigned to teams of about 20, initially split into two halves. The task of the semester is to design a product for the year's theme, and present an alpha prototype at the final presentations. The year I took the class, the theme was "[Rough Tough & Messy](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/interestMedia/themes/theme2016/theme2016.html)", and when I TA'd, the theme was "[Super](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/interestMedia/themes/theme2017/theme2017.html)". Themes are generally intended to be fairly open-ended, but there have been some slightly more focused ones in the past, like "[Food](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/interestMedia/themes/theme2010/theme2010.html)", from 2010. 2.009 is very structured, with milestones roughly every two weeks, and most of the lectures focused in engineering process - ideation, brainstorming, prototyping, testing, consensus-forming. I'll talk more about my experience taking 2.009 in a future blog post though - this one is about TA'ing 2.009.

2.009 overall is characterized by its insanely high production value. Skip through the [final presentations from 2017](https://vimeo.com/247247675#at=2073) to get an idea of that. There are usually 4 TA's for 2.009, and we generally handle all of the media associated with the class - thousands upon thousands of photos, and many terabytes of video footage, not to mention dozens, if not hundreds, of graphics. It's a monumental undertaking - I probably worked at least 60 hours a week on average, more than twice as much as I spent on 2.009 as a student. As I mentioned, it was incredibly rewarding, frustrating, and a distinct learning experience.

## 2.744
[2.744](http://web.mit.edu/2.744/www/index.html) is a graduate product design class, taught every other year by Professor Wallace. Students form teams of about 6, and the primary task of the semester is to design a product for the semester's client - this year, the client was [5 Wits](http://5-wits.com/), a production company by MIT alum Matt Duplessie, and students were tasked with designing gags/games to be used in a new concept that 5 Wits has been exploring. 2.744 is skill-focused, with many lectures on sketching, rendering, prototyping, and general design lectures. There are fewer milestones throughout the semester than 2.009, and teams are much more independent.

2.744 is a much lower-key class than 2.009, but there are still a number of high production value components, and the experience as a whole is still very tightly designed. Again, TA's are generally responsible for the media associated with the class in addition to general class prep. However, the scale is very different - only about 10k photos throughout the semester, as opposed to the roughly 100k from 2.009. The only video components are documentation, and there's no creative video editing to be done.

# Learning - hard skills
I didn't learn many *new* hard skills through TA'ing 2.009 or 2.744, but I definitely sharpened some existing skills. In no particular order:

## Photo Editing
- I got a ton faster at photo editing. With the sheer volume of photos to edit, I got faster out of necessity. That involved memorizing most of Lightroom's keyboard shortcuts.
- I also developed a stronger sense for organizing photos. Most of my photo sets previously have just been ordered chronologically, but photo sets for 2.009 and 2.744 were rearranged creatively for visual interest, telling a story, or visual puns.
- I got even stricter with my folder and naming conventions, again, out of necessity. Unfortunately for 2.009, this effort was confounded by some of the other TA's not always being as strict...
- Memory card organization. I numbered all of our dozens of memory cards, and tried implementing a system for "to dump" cards where the contents were written on a post-it so that the photos could be appropriately sorted and labelled. That too was confounded somewhat by other TA's being not as strict...
- Physical camera organization and operation - in keeping with the theme of organization of large quantities of media/things, I took point on our camera organization, charging setup, and prepping cameras for class, which involved selecting lenses and ensuring each camera had a fresh battery and empty memory card. It doesn't sound like much, but when you do it 3 or more times per week for 4 months, it becomes notable.

## Video Editing
- For 2.009, I didn't actually take or edit that many photos, relatively speaking - I usually shot video during lectures, milestones, and events, and organized all of that media.
- Video editing itself was something I had done only minimally before 2.009. During 2.009, I was the primary editor for two videos: [Teardown](https://vimeo.com/238690617) and the [quadcopter video](https://vimeo.com/247183239). Both of those probably deserve their own post, but basically, video editing is *hard*. I always felt like I needed more footage and more time. Getting high-quality footage is really difficult in the context of 2.009, where most things are filmed run-and-gun style, without enough time to think through things. 2.009 also uses a bunch of different cameras, and it's very difficult to make them all look nice when edited together.
- Flying a quadcopter was something I'd never done before 2.009, and though I've crashed (twice), I consider myself fairly decent at it now. It really gives a unique perspective and raises the production value.

## Other software/tech
- Bash scripts are something I've used before, but not as extensively as I used them in 2.009/2.744. In 2.009, we had a video editing script that Victor wrote a while ago, which you could give a video file, in and out timestamps, and a new name, and it would automatically clip that section from the videos, with a fade in and fade out, and rename it. This was extremely useful for milestones, where I would have to produce 48 video files (1 per idea, so 6 per team) in just a few hours. For 2.744, I had to rename tons of photos - for in-class assignments, I either scanned paper submissions or took photos of every student's submission. I had to edit each of these and then rename them to the student's kerberos, which was easily scriptable.
- To help with the bash scripting, I utilized Google Sheets pretty heavily - columns for different fields and a final column to merge them together appropriately to the command to be invoked. Obviously, bash itself or some other scripting language would be capable of this, but it was easier to visualize and edit in Google Sheets.
- To incrementally back up the many, many terabytes of photos and videos, I used [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync), which is a cool tool that I haven't used before. It definitely beats individually figuring out which folders or files are on which drives.
- Spreadsheets as an organizational tool. I've used spreadsheets before, obviously, but usually in the normal contexts spreadsheets are used - numerical data. I've also used them for puzzle-solving, but that's a different story. Using them for organization is something that makes a lot of sense to me - organizing the camera setup for build challenge was the prime example of this, where I coordinated 42 different cameras to record or photograph simultaneously, and organized all of that data afterwards. It took me nearly 3 days just to dump and back up all of the files from Build Challenge.

# Learning - soft skills

## Designing an experience
- videos are high quality
- photos go up on time
- lecture is set out tidily

## Things are themed consistently

## Working on a team
- specialization vs balancing the workload
- how to appreciate someone else's work when it's not what you're working on

## working with a manager
- first time working with a manager that *wasn't* doing the same things i was
- things i have learned that i value (see notebook)
